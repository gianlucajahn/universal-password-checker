## Universal Password Checker
I built a universal password checker that lets you check if the password that is being entered is considered "strong" and also tells you how many characters have to be edited/added/removed for it to be considered strong, if it's not. 

## Why "Universal"?
The reason I called it a universal password checker is because it is available in 13 of the most popular programming languages. Those are:

- C
- C#
- C++
- GO
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- Perl
- PHP
- Python
- Rust
- Swift
- TypeScript

## How?
This algorythm was built with the help of [OpenAI](https://openai.com)'s [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) AI. ChatGPT helped me convert this code that has originally being written in Java into the other 12 programming languages.
