# Universal Password Checker
This is a universal password checker that lets you check if the password that is being entered is considered "strong" and also tells you how many characters have to be edited/added/removed for it to be considered strong, if it's not. 

### Why "Universal"?
The reason I called it a universal password checker is because it is available in 13 of the most popular programming languages. Those are:

- C
- C#
- C++
- GO
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- Perl
- PHP
- Python
- Rust
- Swift
- TypeScript

### What does "strong" mean?
Any given password is considered strong if all of the following parameter are fulfilled:

- the password does atleast contain 6 characters
- the password does not exceed 20 characters
- the password has atleast one lower case letter
- the password has atleast one upper case letter
- the password has atleast one number
- the password does not have the same letter any more than 2 times in a row

### How?
This algorythm was built with the help of [OpenAI](https://openai.com)'s [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) AI. ChatGPT helped me convert this code that has originally being written in Java into the other 12 programming languages.
